## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Reference

### Essential Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start dev server
npm test                # Run tests
npm run lint            # Check code quality

# Database
npm run prisma:studio   # GUI for PostgreSQL
npm run db:seed         # Seed sample data
npm run prisma:migrate  # Create migration

# Docker
docker-compose up -d    # Start all services
docker-compose ps       # Check status
docker-compose logs     # View logs
docker-compose down     # Stop all services
```

### Useful URLs

- **API Base**: http://localhost:3001/api
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:3001/api/health
- **Auth Login**: http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login
- **Prisma Studio**: http://localhost:5555

### Environment Variables

Key variables to configure:
- `AUTH0_DOMAIN`
- `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`
- `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `AUTH0_AUDIENCE`
- `SESSION_SECRET`

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database won't connect:**
```bash
docker-compose restart postgres mongodb
# Wait 10 seconds
npm run dev
```

**Port 3001 in use:**
```bash
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9
```

**Auth0 callback fails:**
- Check callback URL matches exactly
- Verify Auth0 credentials in `.env`
- Ensure `SESSION_SECRET` is set

**Prisma errors:**
```bash
npm run prisma:generate
npm run prisma:migrate
```

---

## âœ¨ Success Criteria

You're ready to develop when:

- âœ… Server starts without errors
- âœ… Health check returns `"status":"healthy"`
- âœ… Both databases connected
- âœ… Auth0 login redirects properly
- âœ… Tests pass
- âœ… Postman collection works

## ðŸ“š Next Steps

1. **Build Frontend** - Connect to this backend
2. **Add Features** - Extend controllers and services
3. **Write More Tests** - Increase coverage
4. **Deploy to Production** - Use Railway or Vercel
5. **Monitor** - Set up logging and alerts
